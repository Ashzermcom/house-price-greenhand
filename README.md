# house-price-greenhand
This is zyz' home work
He is too lazy to write something.
Since the ori dataset bj_31w has problem about column data format and I
rectify this problem in Excel. So you can't run pre-work.py straightly.
I write the clean data in datasets/house_price.csv.
If you want to train you model, please run python train.py
